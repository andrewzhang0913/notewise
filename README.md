## 🔒 Privacy & Open Source Philosophy

We believe your thoughts belong to you. In an era of cloud-first gathering, NoteWise stands for **Data Sovereignty**.

- **Offline First**: All audio processing and text refinement can run entirely on your local machine.
- **No Vendor Lock-in**: You choose the brain. Connect to **Ollama**, **Dify**, or private LLMs.
- **Secure**: Your data never leaves your "HomeNet" unless you explicitly choose a cloud provider.

### The HomeNet Vision

NoteWise is the entry point to the **HomeNet Project** — an initiative to build a self-reliant, intelligent digital home. It acts as the neural link between your spontaneous thoughts and your **HomeNet Brain** (Knowledge Base).

Whether you are running a high-end server or just a **standard laptop**, NoteWise empowers you to build a powerful local AI workflow without relying on big tech cloud APIs.
