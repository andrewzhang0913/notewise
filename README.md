## 💡 The Story Behind NoteWise

Hi, I'm **Andrew** — a former semiconductor engineer who lost his job and has been self-teaching AI development at home for the past year, dreaming of building something meaningful.

**NoteWise was born out of necessity.** As someone who thinks faster than I type, I found myself drowning in scattered voice memos and half-finished notes. I wanted a tool that could:

- Capture my thoughts **as I speak**
- Transform messy voice notes into **polished, structured writing**
- Work seamlessly with my **Obsidian-based second brain**

So I built it myself, with AI assistance, learning along the way.

**This isn't a startup product with funding** — it's a solo developer's passion project, built during a challenging chapter of life. If NoteWise helps you, **please consider supporting its development.** Every bit of encouragement keeps this project alive.
